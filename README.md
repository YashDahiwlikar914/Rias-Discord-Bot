## Configuration

### Bot Configuration

- **Generative AI Model Settings**: Adjust `generation_config` parameters for response style.
  - `temperature`: Controls creativity. Lower values are more deterministic, higher values more random.
  - `top_p`: Controls the probability distribution for diverse response generation.
  - `top_k`: Limits the number of highest-probability tokens considered for each response.
  - `max_output_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens in the response.

- **Bot Personality and Role**: Modify `system_instruction` to describe the bot's behavior and tone.
  
- **History Management**: Conversation history is stored in `History.json` to maintain context. You can clear this file periodically or configure it to load on each restart for fresh conversations.

---

## Usage

1. **Starting the Bot**
   - Rias will log in and display "Logged On As {Bot Name}!" in the console upon successful connection.
   
2. **Triggering Responses**
   - Mention Rias by name, reply to one of its messages, or send a direct message.
   - You can also configure custom trigger words by adding relevant keywords in the code‚Äôs message filter section.

3. **Example Conversation**
   - **User**: `@Rias How's the weather?`
   - **Rias**: `I'm not a meteorologist, but I can tell you it'll be sunny whenever you're around! üòè`

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot Not Responding**: 
   - Ensure both `API_KEY` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` are valid and have sufficient permissions.
   - Confirm `Intents` are properly configured in the Discord Developer Portal and enabled in the bot.

- **API Error**:
   - Verify that the API key has permissions for Google Generative AI usage.
   - Check your API usage quota and consider reducing `max_output_tokens` if you hit limits.

- **JSON Decode Error**:
   - If you encounter a JSON error in `History.json`, clear the file content or delete the file. The bot will recreate it automatically.

- **Invalid Intent Error**:
   - Ensure `message_content` intent is enabled in both your code and on the Discord Developer Portal for this bot.
